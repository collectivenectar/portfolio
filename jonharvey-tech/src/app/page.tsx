        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          In southern California, I started my career in an entertainment
          capital, Los Angeles. I worked as a writer, a photographer, and a
          videographer, helping fashion brands with a focus on sustainability,
          and reducing their ecological footprint. Challenging mainstream trends
          taught me to craft compelling narratives that resonate with
          hard-to-reach audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2020, I&#39;ve been providing IT business solutions, applying my
          media expertise to offer enhanced user experiences. I focus on the
          user&#39;s journey, underpinned by rigorous market research, usability
          testing, and principles of visual composition and art theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also provide targeted solutions for businesses that struggle to find
          a match in the market for their brand. For example, understanding how
          to engage with popular trends is useful -- but designing workflows to
          repurpose content across multiple platforms, and targeting specific
          locations and demographics is more effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many businesses also fail to grow because they invest little time and
          money on building relationships strong enough to survive big changes.
          I believe in maintaining deep, ongoing dialogue with clients and
          designing a tight feedback loop to successfully bring ideas to market
          and ensure scalable growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use proven principles in my work to develop web solutions that save
          you and your customers time and money so you can get to doing what you
          do best.
